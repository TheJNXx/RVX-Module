This module contains:

- Universal architecture
- Custom branding icon: revancify_red
- Exclude "GmsCore support" patch for compatibility with Google services or [microG](https://microg.org)
- Monet (A12+)

Recommendation: If your ROM has Youtube by default in the system I recommend [this app](https://github.com/sunilpaulmathew/De-Bloater) to delete it, is the best way to delete it without generating a conflict with the module

Or use a clean ROM like LineageOS
