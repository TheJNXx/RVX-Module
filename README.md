**Works in:** Magisk (obviously) - KernelSU - APatch

This module contains:

- Universal architecture
- Custom branding icon: [revancify_red](https://github.com/anddea/revanced-patches/wiki/Icons)
- Exclude "GmsCore support" patch for compatibility with Google services or [microG](https://microg.org)
- Monet (A12+)

Recommendation: If your ROM has Youtube in the system I recommend [this app](https://github.com/sunilpaulmathew/De-Bloater) to "delete it" is the best way to not generate conflict with the module

Or use a clean ROM like LineageOS
